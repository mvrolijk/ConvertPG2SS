The original intention of this program was to convert a large (47GB) PG 9.4 
database to SQL Server 2012 / 2014. As it's growing I thought it would be a 
good idea to make this my first publicly-released GPL program. 

The plan is to eventually include SS-to-PG code also. I love PG as a ORDMS,
and if i can contribute just a little in making PG a more viable db solution
it'll be worth the effort.

It's in a pre-alpha stage, so *caveat emptor*.
